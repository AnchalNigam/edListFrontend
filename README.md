# ToDoList

Design is made using bootstrap4 from scratch for both small screen and desktop.

USER MANAGEMENT PART:
1) In signup part, I gave client side validation part so that user not only get error after submitting the form but also in real time.

2) It has countries list which i have given in ascending order for user ease.Once country is selected, country code automatically comes 
for mobile number field.

3) Field validation is done on client side as well as server side.

4) Once user signup,mail has been sent to user for email confirmation.Before email confirmation, user cant login.

5) Go to mail for verifying yourself,once go to link which is provided in mail, user gets verified.

6) Now user can login with his credentials.

7) User can also reset his/her password.On clicking on reset password, mail has been sent for resetting password process.Once go to link
provided in mail, user go the page where he/she can set his new password.

8) This way user can reset his password and can login with his/her new credentials.

LIST MANAGEMENT PART:
1) In this part, user will be able to create todolist.

2) There is section where all friends list will be displayed. Other section called 'All Users' where all users who are not friend of user will be displayed.

3) There is another section where all todolist  of friends including his own todolist will be listed.

4) User and his friends can add item as well as subitem and this will notify all his friends.

5) User and his friends can edit item and subitem by clicking on edit button and also can make item,subitem ->done(on done item,subitem becomes blur and disabled) by clicking on done button.

6) User and his friends can also delete item,subitem by clicking on delete button.

7) User and his friends can also undo the changes by clciking on button as well as using keyboard shortcut key(ctrl+z).

8) There is another page called 'Friends' where user can see to whom he has sent requests or approve requests.

9) In 'All users' section if user has sent a request and that person has not accepted the request then it will be listed in 'All users' section and if user again click to send friend request then it will notify user that he has already sent a request.

10) Once,that user accepts request, now the person will come to 'friendslist' section.Friends who are online will also show online in this section.
